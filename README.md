# Unity-Shader-Property-Access
There is a wide range of shaders for visual effects in games. Since the release of Shader Graph, the creation of shaders has become more accessible for non-programmers. This has raised the question: how do you set shader variables if you can't code?

This is a small system that helps you to easily edit shader propertys from script or inspector. 

The c# classes can be created with the target renderer and the property name. They will cache the material and shader property id for better performance.The components on the other hand enable non-programmers to edit shader propertys in the inspector.
